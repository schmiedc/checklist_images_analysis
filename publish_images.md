title: Image presentation and publication
---

Today, the output image data of light microscopes is rarely published without image processing steps. Original image data may contain large areas devoid of information (larger and larger field of views; z-stacks; time-course images), or require image processing and/or reconstitution to become human readable as in the case of light-sheet and superresolution microscopy data. Consequently, the definition of what constitutes an original/ raw microscope image is also dynamic. For presentation and publication image data must be clearly understandable and accessible to wide audiences.

Preparing legible images for presentation and publication requires several important steps. Images should focus audiences rapidly on key information with image formatting. Light microscopes capture one or several wavelengths or full color; sensible and effective color display/annotation makes images accessible to wide audiences. The precision of scientific communication requires annotation of object size and, possibly, of image features. For image data review and reproducibility scientists should along with the publication ensure access to original image data.
