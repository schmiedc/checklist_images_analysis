# Publish image analysis

The specific requirements for reporting a particular image analysis workflow will always be unique to the individual workflow, since the analysis in practice is as diverse as the scientific questions and the specific imaging tools employed to answer them. However, to define clear and generalizable guidelines for publishing image analysis we decided to define three distinct classes of image analysis applications that we can observe in the scientific literature. Each of those classes face their own specific challenges when it comes to their reproducibility and therefore require specific recommendations to address them:

1. **Published workflows:** Many image analysis workflows and particularly workflow templates are available in the scientific literature and  can be readily applied to solve specific image analysis problems (Fig Microscopy image analysis A).

2. **Novel workflow:** When a workflow does not exist to solve a particular image analysis challenge, scientists develop new solutions. Existing components available in software platforms or libraries are assembled by researchers into a novel workflow (Fig Microscopy image analysis B).

3. **Machine learning:** The aim of machine learning methods applied to microscopy image data is to create specific results from the input image data. Thus, in principle machine learning is not much different than other image analysis workflows. The key difference is that instead of developing a set of instructions in a program, a model is produced by learning patterns from the data. The precise makeup of this model and how it is interpreting the input data is a black box (Fig Microscopy image analysis C). This unique challenge for reproducibility plus the rapid evolution of the field and the very distinct technical language is justifying a separate set of recommendations.
