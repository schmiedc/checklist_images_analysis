# Introduction

For the long-term benefit of research results, it is important that supportive imaging data is comprehensible, representative and reproducible. Here, we present the guidelines developed in a community-driven effort and the resulting checklist to help the scientific community reach quality standards in image figure publication.

# Scope of checklists

We have developed minimal standards which define non-negotiable requirements for image publication. In recognition of further improving image quality and towards the long-term goal of reaching easily reproducible image preparation and analysis workflows, we also defined one-star and two-star standards. We encourage all scientists to implement one-star recommendations, while two-star recommendations permit easy reproducibility.

Our image and image analysis publication guidelines should be simple and easy to use by diverse target groups. We envision the guidelines and check-lists will orient novice and non-expert (scientists that use light microscopy only occasionally) users in preparing high quality images for publication. The guidelines and accomparning educational materials also help expert users, core facility staff, educators, and the global bioimage community to align their respective practices of image preparation. Through the QUAREP initiative we already integrated representative voices from all continents and imaging hubs worldwide. And finally, the checklist may be adopted by journals, manuscript/grant reviewers and funders to rapidly screen the quality of image publications.

# About WG12

Within the QUAREP-Limi initiative the working group 12 aims to develop community guidelines that help scientists publish accessible and understandable image figures, including their reproducible processing and analysis procedures. The working group members are active in academic and corporate research in light microscopy, image software and science communication, educators, microscopy companies and publishers.
